# Sb Timeseries Functional Reference

This page is part of the SBsql Language Reference Manual. It explains the user-facing language contract while preserving the ScratchBird authority model: SQL text parses to SBLR, durable identity is UUID based, descriptors own type behavior, security is materialized from catalog policy, and MGA owns transaction finality.

Generation task: `sb_timeseries`


## Package Boundary

`sb.timeseries` contains 1 registered built-in operation records. Each record binds a public function, operator, aggregate, window function, or special form to descriptor-aware overloads, null behavior, optimizer properties, SBLR binding, and engine entrypoint metadata.

The package boundary is semantic, not a privilege boundary. A caller still needs object privileges, expression admission, descriptor compatibility, and policy admission for the statement that uses the operation.

## Package Inventory

| Kind | Records |
| --- | --- |
| aggregate | 1 |

## Type Mechanics

- Argument descriptors select the overload.
- Return descriptors come from the declared return type rule.
- Null, collation, charset, timezone, and security behavior are part of binding.
- Optimizer properties may allow constant folding, generated column use, or index eligibility, but execution authority remains with the engine.
- Practical forms below are canonical usage shapes derived from declared overload signatures; statement admission still depends on the surrounding query, object privileges, and descriptor binding.

## Operation Records

### `aggregate`

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Builtin ID | timeseries.aggregate |
| UUID | 019f0000-0000-7000-8000-000000063901 |
| Kind | aggregate |
| Syntax Forms | function_call |
| Overloads | aggregate(...) |
| Return Type Rule | runtime-defined by engine entrypoint aggregate |
| Coercion Rule | descriptor implicit cast matrix or runtime guard |
| Null Behavior | engine runtime entrypoint semantics |
| Collation/Charset Rule | engine runtime entrypoint semantics where text descriptors apply |
| Timezone Rule | engine runtime entrypoint semantics where temporal descriptors apply |
| Volatility | runtime_defined_by_engine_entrypoint |
| Determinism | follows engine runtime entrypoint semantics for stable inputs |
| Side Effects | none unless the engine runtime entrypoint documents otherwise |
| SBLR Binding | sblr.expr.timeseries_aggregate.v3 |
| AST Binding | ast.expr.timeseries_aggregate |
| Engine Entrypoint | aggregate |
| Security Policy | follows engine runtime seed registry authority for timeseries |
| Error Semantics | engine runtime guard diagnostics |

#### Optimizer Properties

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| foldable | False |
| index_eligible | False |
| generated_column_eligible | False |
| cost_class | runtime_seed |

#### Practical Form

```sql
select aggregate(arg_1) from app.orders group by account_id;
```
