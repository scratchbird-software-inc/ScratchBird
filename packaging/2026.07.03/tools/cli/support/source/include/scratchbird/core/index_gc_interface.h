     * IndexGCInterface - Interface for index garbage collection
     *
     * This interface defines the contract between the garbage collector
     * and index implementations. When the heap sweep identifies dead tuples,
     * it calls removeDeadEntries() on each index to clean up references.
     *
     * ## Firebird MGA Design Pattern
     *
     * In Firebird MGA architecture:
     * 1. Indexes store stable TIDs pointing to primary tuple locations
     * 2. When tuples are deleted/updated, heap creates back versions
     * 3. Primary tuple location remains valid (TID never changes)
     * 4. Eventually, when all transactions can't see old versions, tuples become "dead"
     * 5. Heap sweep identifies dead TIDs (those with xmax < OIT)
     * 6. Index GC removes index entries pointing to dead TIDs
     *
     * ## Protocol
     *
     * 1. Heap sweep (GarbageCollector::cleanPage) identifies dead tuples via OIT
     * 2. Sweep collects dead TIDs in a vector
     * 3. For each index on the table, calls removeDeadEntries(dead_tids)
     * 4. Index removes entries pointing to dead TIDs
     * 5. Index returns statistics (entries removed, pages modified)
     *
     * ## Implementation Notes
     *
     * - Method must be safe to call with empty vector (no-op)
     * - Method should be atomic or handle partial failures gracefully
     * - TIDs in the vector are guaranteed to be truly dead (OIT-based)
     * - No need to re-verify tuple liveness - trust the OIT
     * - Performance: Bulk removal is more efficient than one-at-a-time
     *
     * ## Thread Safety
     *
     * - Implementation must handle concurrent index scans during GC
     * - Use appropriate locking (page-level or structure-specific)
     * - Dead entry removal is low priority, can yield to readers

         * Remove index entries pointing to dead tuples
         *
         * Called by garbage collector after heap sweep identifies dead tuples.
         * Implementation should remove all index entries that point to TIDs
         * in the dead_tids vector.

         * @param ctx Error context for diagnostics
         * @return Status::OK on success, error code on failure
         *
         * Error Handling:
         * - OK: All dead entries successfully removed
         * - PARTIAL_FAILURE: Some entries removed, but errors occurred (log warnings)
         * - IO_ERROR: Failed to access index pages
         * - INTERNAL_ERROR: Index structure corruption detected
         *
         * Thread Safety:
         * - Must be safe to call concurrently with index scans (readers)
         * - Should use appropriate locking to prevent corruption
         * - Can block or yield based on implementation strategy
         *
         * Performance:
         * - Bulk operations preferred over per-TID removal
         * - Can scan index once and remove all matching TIDs
         * - Should update statistics (entries_removed, pages_modified)
